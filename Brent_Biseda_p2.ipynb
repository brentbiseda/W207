    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The nearest neighbors does not work well because of the curse of dimensionality.  The majority of the features are missing and the matrix is sparse.  This is made to be worse when the most common words such as 'the', 'be', 'to' are shared widely between the examples and are given additional importance in the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Naive Bayes assumes independence of each feature, while logistic regression does not.  This is evidently important because the development dataset is incomplete where 25% of the features are missing from the training set.  These features  may be the most important features that are strongly related to the various classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "c. Logistic regression estimates a weight vector for each class, which you can access with the coef_ attribute. Output the sum of the squared weight values for each class for each setting of the C parameter. Briefly explain the relationship between the sum and the value of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The value C is inversely related to regularization.  Smaller C results in a higher penalty and Larger C results in a lower penalty.  Therefore, with higher C the coefficients are larger and the sum of the squares increases.  The opposite is true with additional regularization and lower C value.  "

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    " - It appears that the incorrect class is being predicted because of the presence of words that are highly associated with a different class.  For these examples, it appears that religious words such as \"mormon\" are likely present within the atheism category.  It could be possible to set a threshold to have a minimum number of word occurrences in order to cull out specific words that are disproportionately influencing the results. Likewise, it is possible that we could exclude certain words that appear with very high frequency."
